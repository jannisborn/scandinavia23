# Scandinavia summer trip
In summer 2023, we did a 3 week Interrail trip in Scandinavia. The purpose of this website is to share our quite unusual travel route.

## Summary
We were mostly interested in the south of Norway due to its spectacular landscapes such as the fjords (Lysefjord, Geirangerfjord), Preikestolen, Trolltunga, Kjerag Bolten, the Troll wall, the Jotunheimen National park (with the Galdhoppingen) and many other things.
We completed more than 8000km in three weeks. This does not really sound relaxing but it actually was -- we share below how we did it, day by day.

We generally travelled by train, starting from Zurich (CH), via Germany and Denmkar. In the south of Norway we rent a car for a week which we drove from Stavanger to Trondheim. From Lofoten islands (Svolvaer) we had to take a 2-day boat to the North Cape which we left via a 17-hour-bus to Rovaniemi (Finnland). From there we continued with trains.

Throughout the vacation, we either slept underway (~4 nights train, 3 nights boat), in the car (~7 nights), in a spontaneous airbnb (~3 nights) or outdoors  in a bivouac (~3 nights) camped almost every night, either sleeping in the car or.
