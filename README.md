# Scandinavia summer trip
In summer 2023, we did a 3 week Interrail trip in Scandinavia. The purpose of this website is to share our quite unusual travel route.

## Summary
We were mostly interested in the south of Norway due to its spectacular landscapes such as the fjords (Lysefjord, Geirangerfjord), Preikestolen, Trolltunga, Kjerag Bolten, the Troll wall, the Jotunheimen National park (with the Galdhoppingen) and many other things.
We completed more than 8000km in three weeks. This does not really sound relaxing but it actually was -- we share below how we did it, day by day.

We generally travelled by train, starting from Zurich (CH), via Germany and Denmark. In the south of Norway we rent a car (a VW T-Cross) for a week which we drove from Stavanger to Trondheim. We took train and ferry to reach Lofoten islands and then went via a 2-day boat to the North Cape which we left via a 17-hour-bus to Rovaniemi (Finnland). From there we continued with trains.

Throughout the vacation, we either slept underway (~4 nights train, 3 nights boat), in the car (~7 nights), in a spontaneous airbnb (~3 nights) or outdoors in a bivouac (~3 nights).

## Day-by-day:

### Day 1: Zurich - Aarhus

From Zurich we take the night train to Hamburg. We continue to Denmark by train and go camping with friends in Aarhus - south of the city, there are nice camping spots with sand beaches directly next to the forest!

### Day 2: Aarhus - Stavanger

From Aarhus, we travel north to Hirtshals, where we board the ferry to Kristiansand (around 2.5 hours). We visit the city for a couple of hours, but then continue by train with the Interrail ticket to Stavanger. The train ride already provides a glance at the amazing nature that Norway offers!

### Day 3: Stavanger - Odda (Kjeragbolten)

For the south of Norway, we rented a car to be able to reach all hikes and spots we want to see. We pick up the car in Stavanger and will return it one week later in Trondheim. For our first day in Norway, we already had struggled to decide whether to visit Preikestolen or Kjeragbolten, an impressive boulder trapped between the cliffs. The latter is less touristy but much further away. We decided for this option, and drove 2.5h vom Stavanger to the start of the hike (very scenic drive)! The hike (see track [here](https://www.strava.com/activities/9297303547)) is around 5km one-way and offers amazing views of the fjord in the end. There is a ferry going across the fjord that would offer a shortcut to see both Preikestolen and Kjeragbolten, but unfortuntaly it was booked out when we were there. We therefore continued and drove several hours north, to Odda.

### Day 4: Odda (Buarbreen and Trolltunga)

East of the industrial town Odda, there is a massive glacier covering a wide mountainrange. At one spot, you can hike very close to the foothills of the glacier. We started at the same parking lot (only 20 min from Odda), but did the more demanding hike to the top of the Reinanuten mountain (~1100 meters in height to hike up). On the peak, you are super close and slightly above the huge glacier, and get breathtaking views of the huge ice wall. See track [here](https://www.strava.com/activities/9302622694).
Afterwards, we continued with the Trolltunga hike (track [here](https://www.strava.com/activities/9303811030)). We started quite late in early afternoon, but this helped to avoid the large number of tourists queueing at Trolltunga every day. We heard stories of people queuing for 30-60min to get a pic on Trolltunga. If you make the hike, **make it in the evening**!! When we reached the Trolltunga between 7 and 8pm there was only one other group of 3-4 people. We did it in late June, so it did not get dark. There is a shuttle that takes you up a few kilometers more, which reduces the hike to 10 instead of 14km one way. One the hike, one can diverge a bit from the actual trail to get a view of the whole fjord-like lake hundreds of meters below (it's not fully visible from the Trolltunga viewpoint itself). 

### Day 5: Tyssedal - Flam

Mostly a transition day, we stop by Eidfjord where a huge cruise is docked in the port. Watch out for the large bridge going over Eidfjord, the car tunnels are quite confusing because of the roundabouts in the tunnel (yes, you read correctly). There's also a toll on this road and we took it mistakenly triply :see_no_evil In the afternoon we did a fantastic rafting trip on the Strandaelvi, we highly recommend :rowboat . In the evening, we pass by Gutvangen in Naeroyfjord and its famous hotel (Stalheim) but unfortunately the scenic road is under construction. We're driving to Flam where the super popular Flambahn starts that meanders up its way to Myrdal. We follow a tiny dirt road toward Myrdal and camp next to a reservoir lake.

### Day 6: Flam - Laerdalsoyri

The tiny dirt road between Flam and Myradl is incredible. It's one way since you cant go all the way up to Myrdal, so there's little traffic. The road is super scenic, you frequently cross the train tracks (if you spot a train, dont miss out to stop and take a picture) and eventually, the road passes through a super remote valley with a bike rental and a zipline in the middle of nowhere. We couldnt believe our eyes at first but apparently the classical tourist activity is to take the train from Flam up to Myrdal and then roll down the dirt road on MTBs or take the zipline. The last section of the road to Myrdal is MTB-only so we leave our car and start a hike. This was the coldest day of the trip, it was cloudy/rainy and we did a very long hike (>30km) with almost 50% of it going through snow. We did not have enough food and had really underestimated the amount of snow but on the bright side we passed by almost a dozen of lakes, all in different stages of frozenness (from all-open to all-frozen with snow on top). We did not see a single person the whole hike and the area was so remote that neither the lakes nor the mountains had names so it's tough to describe but find the track [here](https://www.strava.com/activities/9315838529).

### Day 7: Laerdalsoyri -
